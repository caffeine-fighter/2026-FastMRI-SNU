# 2026 FastMRI SNU

VarNet experiments and Phase 2 submission tooling for the 2026 SNU FastMRI Challenge. VESSL is the source of truth for all `EXP###` runs and official evaluation.

## Live VESSL status

_Last update: 2026-07-12 19:24 KST (2026-07-12 10:24 UTC)_

| Check | Value |
|---|---|
| Run | `EXP032_varnet_c6_ch12_s8_e30` (running) |
| Change | `cascades 4 to 6; all else fixed` |
| Progress | epoch `24/30`, iteration `310/4651`, `80.2%` |
| ETA | `7.91 hours`; finish `2026-07-13 03:19 KST (2026-07-12 18:19 UTC)` |
| Best validation loss | epoch `23`: `3.1766005954935492` |
| Validation snapshot | pending final validation |
| Health | `0` error matches; checkpoints `present` |

`EXP031` remains the one-shot official leader while this one-variable experiment trains. No official evaluation starts automatically.

## Official result

| Candidate | Evidence | SSIM_full | SSIM_bbox | Quality | Time | Total score |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `EXP030_varnet_c4_ch12_s8_e20` | 30-run minimum | 0.9178 | 0.9108 | 0.9143 | 173.4 ms/slice | 0.9152513541666667 |
| `EXP031_varnet_c4_ch12_s8_e30` | one official run | **0.9191** | **0.9114** | **0.91525** | **173.1 ms/slice** | **0.9162015104166666** |

EXP031 leads the completed official runs by `+0.00095015625` versus EXP030's finalized 30-run score. It stays protected while the 40-day optimization program searches for a stronger final candidate; the final timing cohort is deferred until model freeze.

Local promotion uses leaderboard-faithful equal-acceleration validation quality. EXP031's reference is `0.9154137446412757`; its historical pooled diagnostic `0.9174406281804748` is not the promotion threshold.

## Common commands

```bash
# Check repository safety
python scripts/check_submission.py

# Evaluate one experiment on validation data
python scripts/evaluate_val.py \
  --exp-name <EXP_NAME> \
  --target-dir /root/Data/val/image \
  --recon-dir ../result/<EXP_NAME>/reconstructions_val \
  --out-dir ../result/<EXP_NAME>/metrics

# Check the official wrapper before an approved run
bash scripts/phase2_preflight.sh
```

Official leaderboard entrypoint:

```bash
mkdir -p ../result/test_Varnet/checkpoints
cp /path/to/submitted/best_model.pt ../result/test_Varnet/checkpoints/best_model.pt
bash recon_eval.sh
```

`recon_eval.sh` defaults to the EXP030 architecture: cascade 4, 12 channels, and 8 sensitivity-map channels.

## Repository map

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `train.py` | VESSL training entrypoint |
| `reconstruct.py` | Reconstruction entrypoint |
| `recon_eval.sh` | Official Phase 2 entrypoint |
| `scripts/` | Validation, preflight, scoring, and reporting helpers |
| `experiments/experiment_log.csv` | Experiment registry |
| `reports/phase2/` | Official score and submission reports |
| `docs/` | Workflow, status, rules, and decision history |

## Non-negotiable rules

- Do not modify `recon_eval.py`.
- Do not run official evaluation while training is active or without approval.
- Treat mounted `Data` directories as read-only.
- Never commit data, H5 files, checkpoints, result directories, `.env` files, or credentials.
- Keep `LOCAL_` probes exploratory; only VESSL `EXP###` runs can become official candidates.
